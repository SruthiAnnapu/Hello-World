Dear Raghu Lakshman Gundra, you mention that you would like to change your application to a job seeking application. Please be aware that a job seeking permit is given in connection with your previous permit, in your case from 21/6-2020. Do you still want to change to a job seeking application? In that case you need to send in the following: -The submitted bank statement does not show you have enough funds to support yourself 12 months from today and is not sufficient. Please submit an updated bank statement or other documents with the required funds of 12 months x 8514 SEK. (the time may be shorter due to the fact that it is now march and the permit may be given to the 21/6-2021).-The Migrations Agency needs an official certificate from the university you are attending, that includes information about your completed studies. Please submit your official degree certificate or official proof that you have applied for that. Please also submit an updated transcript of records of shows that you have taken all remaining credits. The Migration Agency needs the requested information no later than 2021-03-18. 

Required documents:

1.Bank statements
2.Official certificate from the university (completed studies)
3.Official degree certificate
4.Updated transcript of records (remaining credits)


Hi,

I had recieved a query regarding the job seeking visa on the date 04-03-2021. I'm here answering the query and attaching the required documents. 

Yes, I would like to change my application to a job seeking visa from 21-06-2020 to 21-06-2021. From the date I recieved the query (04-03-2021) I do have the sufficient funds to the date (21-06-2021) in my bank account. Here I'm attaching the updated bank statements as reference.

For the query about an official certificate from the University: I had completed all the couces at BTH and I'm here attaching the Ladok certificate. I had applied for the official degree certificate and I'll be geting it soon.
